      <h2>What is difference between Localstorage vs Sessionstorage</h2>
      <p>
        SessionStorage is similar to localStorage. The difference is that while
        data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared
        when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a
        particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and
        assigned to that particular tab.

      <h2>What is difference between global scope and block scopee</h2>
      <p>
        The main difference between the local scope and block scope is that the
        block statements (e.g. if conditions or for loops), don't create a new
        scope. So the var keyword will not have an effect, because the variables
        are still in the same scope. ES6 introduced block scope by using the let
        and const keywords.

      <h2>How to work javascript event loop</h2>
      <p>
        The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the
        Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
        first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
        effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event
        Loop.
